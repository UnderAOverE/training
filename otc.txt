To create a DataFrame in Python from MongoDB documents and use it in Streamlit and Plotly charts, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip if you don't have them already:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas pymongo streamlit plotly
   ```

2. **Connect to MongoDB and Fetch Data**:
   Assuming you have a MongoDB connection, use `pymongo` to fetch the data. If you have the data in a local file or variable, adjust accordingly.

3. **Create DataFrame from MongoDB Documents**:
   Here’s how you can convert the MongoDB documents into a pandas DataFrame. This example assumes you have a `collection` object from `pymongo`.

4. **Parse Nested Fields**:
   Use pandas to normalize nested JSON structures and create new columns for each level of nesting that you want to analyze.

5. **Use Streamlit and Plotly for Visualization**:
   Streamlit and Plotly make it easy to create interactive visualizations.

Here’s a Python example to illustrate these steps:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient
import streamlit as st
import plotly.express as px

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['your_database']
collection = db['your_collection']

# Fetch data from MongoDB
documents = list(collection.find())

# Create DataFrame from MongoDB documents
df = pd.json_normalize(documents)

# Convert nested operation_details to separate columns
operation_details_start = pd.json_normalize(df['operation_details.start'])
operation_details_stop = pd.json_normalize(df['operation_details.stop'])

# Merge the DataFrame
df = df.drop('operation_details', axis=1)
df = pd.concat([df, operation_details_start.add_prefix('start_'), operation_details_stop.add_prefix('stop_')], axis=1)

# Streamlit UI for selecting filters
st.title("MongoDB Data Visualization with Plotly")
filter_object_type = st.selectbox('Select Object Type', df['object_type'].unique())
filter_sector = st.selectbox('Select Sector', df['sector'].unique())
filter_region = st.selectbox('Select Region', df['region'].unique())
filter_environment = st.selectbox('Select Environment', df['environment'].unique())

# Filter DataFrame based on user selection
filtered_df = df[
    (df['object_type'] == filter_object_type) &
    (df['sector'] == filter_sector) &
    (df['region'] == filter_region) &
    (df['environment'] == filter_environment)
]

# Plot number of operations by object type
fig = px.bar(filtered_df, x='object_type', y='start_status', color='start_status',
             title='Number of Operations by Object Type and Status')

# Display the chart in Streamlit
st.plotly_chart(fig)
```

### Key Steps:

1. **Connect to MongoDB**: Replace `'your_database'` and `'your_collection'` with your actual MongoDB database and collection names.

2. **Normalize Nested JSON Fields**: `pd.json_normalize()` helps to flatten nested fields for better analysis. This is crucial for nested fields like `operation_details`.

3. **Streamlit UI Components**: Streamlit's `selectbox()` allows users to filter data interactively.

4. **Plotly Charts**: Plotly is used to create interactive charts that are displayed in Streamlit.

### Notes:
- Replace `start_status` and other field names based on your actual field names in the dataset.
- If you want to plot more advanced visualizations, explore other Plotly chart types and options.
