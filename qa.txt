Otherwise I said you could do some rolling upgrade and have some backends running different code during the upgrade procedure. He said it was more or less in the right ballpark and I was able to talk through my thought process so even if it was wrong I think he appreciated the methodology.

what is error 500 on a web page.  
how will you troubleshoot a process in linux?  - my answer was using, netstat, ps, lsof, gdb, top. the answer he was expecting was thread dump. this was troubleshooting httpd. you can only thread dump on java but i didn't want to argue with the guy, i just said I dont use that. He thinks he can do thread dump on any process obviously he never really troubleshooted any process in linux.

what is error 500?  
Describing a full redundant, resilient, multi region servers (no point of failure, live 24/7) dns, load balancers, firewalls, applications servers, and Databases.  - I attempted to setup on aws but the guy insisted to do something else saying he is better on aws and there could be a question that i cant answer so he asked me to do something that i did before (i am not sure how many people in the world did a setup like this anyways) so I tried to do something with conventional way , it wast that good because it is not possible to do it with out a cloud infrastructure. - There is no such thing is as no downtime, who ever claiming that is lying. want proof? search google for "amazon downtime" you will see lots of them, so if they claim that you can make no downtime setup via aws , so i am asking why they cant do it for their website, i am not talking about aws services even just the web site. plus most of the services they claim to be globally available, elastic, ...etc its not %100 true. The guy who was an system architect at amazon was so proud of himself that he knows how to setup no downtime setup not in just 1 way but multiple ways, obviously he has no idea what he was talking about and he himself even probably believes in this lie. if there is such thing possible than we wouldn't see healthcare.gov, google.com Microsoft.com , amazon.com websites down ever, which is not the reality. - I guess the guy was talking about 100% availabilty is subjective to the acceptable RPO/RTO as with 0 values you will have an absolute availability figure to achieve, which is impossible. The Web and Business logic tiers are easy to scale horizontally, the point here is the DB/Data tier that is not possible to scale effectively with 100% consistency, especially when you talk multi regional, if you have active passive cluster there is a limit on how far you can place these.. several tens of miles with direct FO connectivity.. now the alternative was redundancy with snapshot replication, but here again, you will loose the last snapshot update to failure data.. With Dynamo DB or MySql replications even in the cloud there will still be an RPO - You can deploy Web, application and data tier in two geographically different datacenters with traffic routed to the webtier through DNS weighted or round-robin to the Loadbalancer VIP. You can deploy multiple nodes of LB, applicaition and database for hardware redundancy. Similarly redundany on your routers, firewalls and loadbalancers in each location. The databaces need to be in active/active or active/standby by using various replication mechanisms to serve the customer traffic.

Tell me about a situation where you disagree with your manager  

Scenario-Based questions such as: "A time that you went beyond the expectation of the customer", "A time when you were the only person in the room with an different opinion or approach to a solution and how you handled that". Anybody serving long enough in the field will have solid examples of these, the real trick is being prepared and being able to articulate them on the fly and in serious depth.  
I’ve actually interviewed for (and received a job offer from Amazon) so I can shed a little bit of insight on what the process looks like.

There’s on strategy that works VERY well when interviewing for companies like Amazon.
I call them… POWER STORIES

The concept here is pretty basic.
Create a list of your most impressive professional accomplishments.
Did you improve a process a work the increased speed?
Did you find a solution to a problem that was creating quality errors?
Did you deliver a presentation that landed a key client?
Basically, you want to think of every situation where you’ve had a positive/major impact on your company.
Format the Stories
Once you’ve got all your accomplishments written out, you’ll want to expand each one into a detailed story.
Here are the pieces your story needs to have (borrowing from the STAR method)

Situation - Set up the context. What was the problem that you eventually solved?
Task - What game plan did you develop to solve this problem?
Action - (The bulk of your answer) What steps did you to take to execute your plan?
Result - How did things end? Did you achieve your goal and solve the problem? Did you fail? If so, what did you learn?
Practice Telling Your Stories

Now that you know your stories, you’ve got to practice them!
Verbally run through your stories, one by one, refining your delivery every time.
Focus on being as concise as possible with your answers. You don’t want to bore the interviewer.
Build up the tension when you talk about the problem.
Focus on what YOU specifically did when you talk about the action taken.
Practice, practice, practice, practice.
Apply Your Stories to Various Interview Questions
Once you’ve got your stories nailed down, the next step is to be able to apply them to various interview questions.
You can Google this, and come up with plenty to choose from. But I personally like to go with the “Behavioral Questions” since those are the type the Amazon asked during my interview.
Try and see how many different questions you can apply each question to. That way, when you’re actually in the interview, you’ll be prepared for any kind of question the recruiter throws at you.
You’ll need to tweak different parts of how you deliver your answer to fit the question.
Use Glassdoor to Find Interview Questions

I did a quick search of Glassdoor for the Technical Account Manager Position at Amazon, and here are some of the questions I found:
How did you handle a situation/made a decision when you did not have all the data?
Describe a situation where you had to troubleshoot an issue after implementation and what you learned
What would you do if your pager goes off in the middle of the night since one your customers is experiencing a DDoS attack?
With a quick search, I’m sure you can find more to practice with!

Again, this is the exact same process I used to land a job offer from Amazon.

Hope this helps!
