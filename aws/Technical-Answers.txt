
How do you improve architecture?
	Improve the ability to add new technologies and new capabilities.
	Implement better monitoring and alerting systems.
	Reduce maintenance costs.
	Consolidate and simplify BAU activities.
	
How do you perform zero downtime deployments?
	A/B Switch: Have standby nodes where the new version is deployed and traffic is diverted. This also called as Red/Black deployment with Black being the idle nodes. Main drawback is some nodes are idle all the time.
	Software LB: Software LB fronts the application and the traffic is routed based on more than one end-point. Main drawback is to develop applications which are compatible with this approach. Netflix Zuul is one such software LBs where the traffic is routed based on end-points and routes.
	Blue/Green: You can do a blue-green release if you've tested the new version in a testing environment and are very certain that the new version will function correctly in production.
	Canary: Incremental deployment, where the traffic is split usually using LBs to send the set of users to new version and then slowly routed the whole traffic there.
