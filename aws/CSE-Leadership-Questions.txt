		T: Identify and consolidate the various internal deployment tools that were being used, this was to reduce the licensing footprint and create a global catalog of softwares.
		A: I got the copy of internal Org chart and based on that I scheduled meetings with teams across the time zones but the participation was low. Reached out to my manager for advice he said to try harder and escalate to respective team managers. I asked my senior colleagues was advice and that when I found out that htis was a long standing project initiative with little traction prior to my arrivals due to major re-org that Citi has just undergone.
		R: Despite my best efforts I was not able to gather the comprehensive list. The project was deprecated as it was replaced by automation initiative which provided the answers to vendor consolidation and version control across the LOBs (Line of Business).

		A:
		R:
	b) Tell me about a time when you solved a problem through just superior knowledge or observation:
		Observed high CPU utilization on web servers - which was initially suspicion was DDos and later engaging the SOC/Network teams which was determined that was not the case. While analyzing the logs with mpmstats module enabled - I observed that more threads were being consumed by mod_log module that correlated with the recent change we made for external syslog (Splunk) which we were forwarding the logs to. After disabling the syslog the CPU utilization came down to normal operational levels.

6) Hire & Develop The Best:

		Citibank has a great internship program where Computer Science Graduates are given opportunity to work in Information Technology space with current technologies, I was assigned two such interns with whom I worked closely on a Proof of Concept project to replace Apache web servers with Nginx as part of Cloud On-boarding and Adaptation. In the first few days I was able to gauge their understanding of e-commerce/ web applications inner workings and identified the areas of improvement and suggested them to utilize online training courses offered at Citi. We had daily 15 minutes stand-up meetings to go over the todays tasks and peer grooming sessions which helped them and also me as I was learning about Nginx in detail.

		A: I have come up with a plan to have 2 to 3 internal meetings with the rest of team and brain storm the areas of improvement, some of the things I can remember from that list are file systems cleanup (usage > 90% - mostly log files), performance monitoring alerts (CPU, Memory, IO & Disk Usage), patching 100s of servers (servers are not connected to Internet and requires local repos.), user management (Mostly Production Support team where privileged access is granted to perform Production changes), File transfers (application logs are sent to Business team for analysis), Scanning for vulnerabilities and etc.
		R: We made good progress and divided them in to groups depending on the complexity of the scripts which are going to be needed. Half way in to the project I started to realize my co-worker lack of interest in completing his tasks which later I discovered that his contract (current job) is going to end soon and not going to be renewed. He started attending interviews during the day and slacked off his efforts. I consulted with my manager regarding the current situation and informed him about the danger of not meeting deadlines. I was able to convince my manager in providing extra resource in completing the task and was able to meet our deadlines.
